Timings:
========
     9.00 - 12.30
    13.30 - 16.30

If you are on a Diamond machine, setup vscode with:
    module load vscode/1.42.1

You also need to setup your C/C++ compiler:
    module load gcc/9.2.0

If you want a more up to date version of vscode, note that some Diamond machines only work with vscode if you use the no-sandbox option
(but don't try this with vscode/1.42.1):
    code --no-sandbox .

Note: if you dial in with NoMachine I've found I can't get versions after 1.42.1 to work, even with the no-sandbox option.

To clone this repository:
    cd 
    git clone https://github.com/seddon-software/CC.git
    cd CC
    code .

You may need to install the Python and C/C++ extensions:
    code --install-extension ms-python.python
    code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools

Alternatively, you can enter:
    @recommended

in the extensions search bar.

If you've downloaded the examples already and you want to get updates:
    git pull

If this fails because you've made changes to some of the code, then stash your changes before you pull:
    git stash
    git pull


Note that the example have a .vscode folder that defines tasks and launch configurations.  To ensure
these settings are used you must start vscode from the top level directory (i.e. CC) as detailed above.

Note that each time you debug a C file I run the make task:
    make -i -B
This ensures make continues after errors and rebuilds each executable unconditionally, just in case the executable was built on another machine.
