You also need to setup your C/C++ compiler:
    module load gcc/9.2.0

The shared library examples on this course are available as a Juypter Notebook.  You will need to install
Python 3.7 or better to get these to work:
    module load python/3.7

To clone this repository:
    cd 
    git clone https://github.com/seddon-software/CC.git
    cd CC
    code .

If you've downloaded the examples already and you want to get updates:
    git pull

If this fails because you've made changes to some of the code, then stash your changes before you pull:
    git stash
    git pull
