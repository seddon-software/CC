Overview
========
This is an example of CMake; the source files to be built are stored in the src directory.
To see the source files, type:
    tree src

To run CMake use the script:
    build_and_run

This will invoke CMake to create executables and then run these executables.

Details
=======
Build files are usually generated in a seperate folder that can be easily removed.  If you inspect the build_and_run script you will see the line:
    cmake -S src -B build

This defines the source and build directories; the command creates all the necessary build files in the build directory.  By default
these files are based on the make utility.  To remove the build files:
    rm -rf build

The actual build is performed by the command:
    cmake --build build

The executable files will be placed in the src tree.  To remove them type:
    cmake --build build --target clean

Alternatively, run:
    cmake --build build --clean-first

This will clean before building.

The build_and_run script performs the above and additionally invokes the executable files in the src tree.
