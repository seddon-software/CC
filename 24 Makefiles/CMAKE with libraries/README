This is another example of CMake, but this time a group of source files are used to to be build a
shared library:
    lib/f1.c
    lib/f2.c
    lib/f3.c
    lib/f4.c
    
The shared library will be created in the build-lib folder:
    build-lib/libmylib.so

This library is then linked with a compiled main program:
    src/main.c

The resulting executable is stored in the build folder:
    build/main

To run CMake use the script:
    generate_build_and_run.sh

This will invoke CMake twice; the first to create the shared library and the second to build and link the shared library and the main program
