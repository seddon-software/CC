The Advanced C Programming course will cover a number of worked examples and contain Jupyter 
Notebook examples for building libraries.  It will be assumed you are using Linux on a Diamond 
computer with your normal login.  If you want to use a different operating system you will need
make sure you can run the examples yourself; there will not be time to help you setup a Windows
or MacOS machine once the course starts.  If you intend to do this, please check you can run 
a "Hello World" application and fire up Jupyter Notebook.

I'll be running most of the examples in Visual Studio Code (vscode), but you can use the command line, 
vim or Eclipse if you prefer.

Although we won't cover this on the course, you might wish to install the Jupyter C kernel, so you can
try writing C code in a browser:

    python -m pip install jupyter-c-kernel --user
    cd $HOME/.local/bin
    ./install_c_kernel --user

To check which kernels have been installed:

    jupyter kernelspec list

Before you start the notebook perform a little CSS customisation by running:

    cd resources
    ./setup
    cd ..

This will copy custom.css to the Jupyter config directory.

Then to start Jupyter notebook:

    jupyter notebook --browser firefox &
