The Intermediate C Programming course will cover a number of worked examples and contain Jupyter 
Notebook examples for building libraries.  It will be assumed you are using Linux on a Diamond 
computer with your normal login.  If you want to use a different operating system you will need
make sure you can run the examples yourself; there will not be time to help you setup a Windows
or MacOS machine once the course starts.  If you intend to do this please notify the trainer on:
    seddon_software@btinternet.com

Please follow the instuctions below to get your Diamond account ready for the course:

Before anything else you need to setup your environment by typing the following on the command 
line:
    module load python/3.7
or
    module load python/3.8

Make sure you don't have any other versions of Python or gcc loaded - unload as necessary.  For example:

    module unload python/ana

I'll be running most of the examples in Visual Studio Code (vscode), but you can use the command line, 
vim or Eclipse if you prefer.

To run the Jupyter Notebook tutorials we need to first install Jupyter C kernel:

    python -m pip install jupyter-c-kernel --user
    cd $HOME/.local/bin
    ./install_c_kernel --user

To check which kernels have been installed:

    jupyter kernelspec list

Before you start the notebook perform a little CSS customisation by running:

    cd resources
    ./setup
    cd ..

This will copy custom.css to the Jupyter config directory.

Then to start Jupyter notebook:

    jupyter notebook --browser firefox &

Just for the record, the tutorials were downloaded with:

    git clone https://github.com/seddon-software/linux_intro.git
