The scripts in this project attempt to build static and shared libraries
The src directory contains the source file:
	f_main.c

The mylib directory contains the source files:
    f1.c f2.c f3.c

The f_main.c program calls functions f1(), f2() and f3().  These functions are 
implemented in f1.c, f2.c and f3.c

The scripts build both a static library in the mylib directory:
	libf.a
and a shared library
	libf.so
