The scripts in this project attempt to build static and shared libraries
The src directory contains source files:
	f_main.c f2.c f3.c
The f-main.c program calls functions f1(), f2() and f3().  The last two functions are 
implemented in f2.c and f3.c, but f1() is implemented in a library.

The mylib directory contains the missing f1.c file.  The scipts build a static library:
	libf1.a
and a shared library
	libf1.so
